The goal of this project was to make a player program for a game coded in a ruby script you can find in resources.

In the game, each player must put a piece on a board with some restrictions, the goal is to prevent the other player to be able to play pieces.
The ruby script launches the two player programs and give them input containing the new state of the board when it is their turn, the player program must return a result and wait for the next input.

The resources folder contains the game script as well as some example player programs.

In the Ruby folder, I put some slightly modified versions of the game script that allows to better evaluate a player program 's performance.
