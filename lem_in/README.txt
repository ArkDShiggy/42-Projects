The input is an "antfarm", a list of rooms and links between rooms (basically a graph).
There is a start room with N ants in it and an end room.
The program must find how to bring all ants from the start room to the end room in the least amount of turns.
Each turn, every ant can move to an adjacent room but except for the start room and the end room, no room can contain two ants or more at the same time.
